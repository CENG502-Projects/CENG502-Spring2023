# Attacking Deep Reinforcement Learning With Decoupled Adversarial Policy 
Adam Gleave, Michael Dennis, Cody Wild, Neel Kant, Sergey Levine, Stuart Russell

Deep reinforcement learning (RL) policies are known to be vulnerable to adversarial perturbations to their observations, similar to adversarial examples for classifiers. However, an attacker is not usually able to directly modify another agent's observations. This might lead one to wonder: is it possible to attack an RL agent simply by choosing an adversarial policy acting in a multi-agent environment so as to create natural observations that are adversarial? We demonstrate the existence of adversarial policies in zero-sum games between simulated humanoid robots with proprioceptive observations, against state-of-the-art victims trained via self-play to be robust to opponents. The adversarial policies reliably win against the victims but generate seemingly random and uncoordinated behaviour. We find that these policies are more successful in high-dimensional environments, and induce substantially different activations in the victim policy network than when the victim plays against a normal opponent.

# 1. Introduction

This paper titled "Attacking Deep Reinforcement Learning with Decoupled Adversarial Policy" was published in the IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing. The goal of this work is to propose a novel approach for exploiting the vulnerability of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) systems with adversarial attacks. Our goal is to reproduce the results presented in the paper and evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has shown remarkable success in solving complex tasks, such as game playing, robotics, and autonomous driving. However, recent studies have shown that DRL systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where an attacker can manipulate the input to the system and cause it to produce incorrect outputs. Adversarial attacks on DRL systems can have severe consequences, such as safety risks, privacy breaches, and financial losses. Therefore, it is crucial to develop effective defence mechanisms against adversarial attacks on DRL systems.

One approach to developing effective defence mechanisms is to understand the vulnerabilities of DRL systems and the methods used to exploit them. This paper proposes a novel approach for attacking DRL systems using Decoupled Adversarial Policy (DAP). The DAP approach decomposes the adversarial policy into two sub-policies: the switch policy and the lure policy. The switch policy determines whether the attacker should launch an attack, while the lure policy determines which action the attacker induces the victim to take. By inducing the victim to take a specific action, the attacker can mislead the DRL system and obtain misleading results. The proposed method is shown to be more efficient and practical than existing methods for attacking DRL systems.

The goal of this work is to reproduce the results presented in the paper and evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Reproducing the results is essential for verifying the claims made in the paper and ensuring that the proposed method is reliable and robust. Additionally, evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed method is crucial for understanding its potential for practical applications and identifying its limitations. By reproducing the results and evaluating the proposed method, we can contribute to the development of effective defence mechanisms against adversarial attacks on DRL systems.

The paper proposes a Decoupled Adversarial Policy (DAP) approach for attacking the policy networks in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) systems. The DAP is decomposed into two sub-policies: the switch policy and the lure policy. The switch policy determines whether the attacker should launch an attack, while the lure policy determines which action the attacker induces the victim to take. By inducing the victim to take a specific action, the attacker can mislead the DRL system and obtain misleading results. The proposed method is shown to be more efficient and practical than existing methods for attacking DRL systems

The paper titled "Attacking Deep Reinforcement Learning with Decoupled Adversarial Policy" presents a comprehensive study on exploiting the vulnerability of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) systems through adversarial attacks. The authors propose a novel approach called Decoupled Adversarial Policy (DAP) to launch effective attacks on DRL mechanisms. The DAP approach decomposes the adversarial policy into two sub-policies: the switch policy and the lure policy. The switch policy determines whether the attacker should launch an attack, while the lure policy determines the action that the attacker induces the victim to take.

The paper's contributions lie in the development of the DAP approach, which offers several advantages over existing methods for attacking DRL systems. Firstly, by decomposing the adversarial policy, the DAP approach provides more flexibility and control to the attacker, allowing for more targeted and effective attacks. Secondly, the DAP approach introduces the concept of a lure policy, which enables the attacker to influence the victim's actions strategically. This strategic influence can lead to misleading results and compromise the integrity of the DRL system.

The proposed DAP approach is evaluated through experiments conducted on four different DRL environments. The experiments aim to verify the effectiveness of the DAP approach from various aspects. The paper addresses two research questions: (1) Can the proposed DAP launch successful attacks with a small number of injecting times in different reinforcement learning tasks? (2) In which states do the proposed DAP launch the attack and inject perturbations? The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the DAP approach in launching successful attacks with minimal injecting times across different reinforcement learning tasks. The paper also provides insights into the states where the DAP approach is most effective in launching attacks and injecting perturbations.

The proposed DAP approach offers a significant contribution to the field of adversarial attacks on DRL systems. By decomposing the adversarial policy into the switch and lure policies, the DAP approach provides a more sophisticated and targeted method for attacking DRL mechanisms. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the DAP approach and highlight its potential for building more robust DRL systems. The findings of this paper have implications for the development of defence mechanisms against adversarial attacks on DRL systems and contribute to the broader understanding of the vulnerabilities and security challenges in the field of DRL.

## 1.2. Architecture Overview
This section covers the backbone architecture along with 5 components:

* Environment
* Victim Agent
* Policy Deduction Stage
* Database Construction Stage
* Attack Launching Stage

### Environment
![environment](https://github.com/CENG502-Projects/CENG502-Spring2023/assets/47499605/7dc9c56c-7299-4acc-ba0d-e084649e7960)

The proposed method is tested on 4 different dynamical environments that is used in common for RL-related methods. These are:
1. Pong
2. Breakout
3. Mspacman
4. Enduro

We tested our implementation only on the Pong environment. Importantly, adversarial attackers have access to the victim's testing environment and the environment supplies the current state `s_t` to the victim agent.

### Victim Agent
![victim-agent](https://github.com/CENG502-Projects/CENG502-Spring2023/assets/47499605/f438388e-db58-4b91-b7a6-2c441347725b)

The victim agent is a PPO network that takes its input `s_t` from the environment and returns the attack policy associated with the current state `Ï€(s_t)`. The victim agent aims to learn the optimal policy in such a way that it maximizes the `R` (return of a policy) where R is computed as:

![equation](https://github.com/CENG502-Projects/CENG502-Spring2023/assets/47499605/ee937cad-31cc-4a55-bde8-f711a20d93ef)

where  $\gamma \in [0, 1]$ is a discount factor indicating how much the agent values an intermediate reward compared with a future reward.


### Policy Deduction Stage
![policy-deduction-stage](https://github.com/CENG502-Projects/CENG502-Spring2023/assets/47499605/dbbda990-5650-45ae-9370-8429622df749)

The policy Deduction Stage consists of several backbone components. Attack policy is given to the fully connected layer and the current is given to the 2D convolutional layer and the outputs of the aforementioned two operations are concatenated together as an attempt to be passed to the LSTM network as an input. After successive timesteps in LSTM, the output is given two Fully connected networks: `Lure Policy` and `Switch Policy`. The role of them is given below:
The Policy Deduction Stage is a crucial component of the proposed DAP approach. It involves several backbone components that work together to generate the switch and lure policies. The attack policy is given to a fully connected layer, while the current state is given to a 2D convolutional layer. The outputs of these two operations are concatenated together to form a one-dimensional feature vector. This feature vector is then passed to an LSTM network as an input. The LSTM network is responsible for capturing sequential features and processing the input over successive timesteps. After processing the input, the output is given to two fully connected networks: the Lure Policy and the Switch Policy.

- **The Lure Policy** is responsible for determining which action the attacker should induce the victim to take. The Lure Policy takes the output of the LSTM network as input and outputs a probability distribution over possible actions. The Lure Policy is designed to strategically influence the victim's actions to achieve the attacker's objectives. By inducing the victim to take a specific action, the attacker can mislead the DRL system and obtain misleading results.

- **The Switch Policy** is responsible for determining whether the attacker should launch an attack. The Switch Policy takes the output of the LSTM network as input and outputs a probability distribution over two possible actions: attack or no attack. The Switch Policy is designed to determine whether the current state is critical enough to warrant an attack. If the Switch Policy outputs a high probability of attack, the attacker launches an attack by injecting perturbations into the system.

### Database Construction Stage
The Database Construction Stage is a critical component of the DAP approach. It involves constructing a database of universal perturbations that can be used to induce the victim agent to take specific actions. The attacker samples states from the environment and classifies them into different categories based on the victim's original action and the induced action with respect to the state. For each specific category, the attacker generates a universal perturbation and stores it in the database. The universal perturbation can be used in real-time to induce the victim agent to take a specific action.

The Database Construction Stage is designed to provide the attacker with a pre-constructed database of universal perturbations that can be used to launch attacks in real time. By classifying the states into different categories, the attacker can generate perturbations that are specific to each category. This approach enhances the efficiency and practicality of the DAP approach by reducing the number of perturbation injection times required to launch an attack.


### Attack Launching Stage
The Attack Launching Stage is the final component of the DAP approach. It involves injecting the corresponding perturbations into the victim agent's state to induce it to take a specific action. The attacker uses the pre-constructed database of universal perturbations generated in the Database Construction Stage to query the specific perturbations according to the victim agent's original action and induced action. The attacker then injects the corresponding perturbations into the victim agent's state to induce it to take a specific action.

The Attack Launching Stage is designed to be efficient and practical by utilizing the pre-constructed database of universal perturbations. By querying the database, the attacker can quickly obtain the corresponding perturbations and inject them into the victim agent's states. This approach reduces the number of perturbation injection times required to launch an attack, making the DAP approach more efficient and practical than existing methods.

Overall, the Attack Launching Stage is a critical component of the DAP approach, as it enables the attacker to induce the victim agent to take specific actions and obtain misleading results. By injecting perturbations into the victim agent's states, the attacker can manipulate the DRL system and compromise its integrity. The DAP approach's effectiveness in launching attacks in the Attack Launching Stage is demonstrated through the experimental results presented in the paper.

# 2. The method and my interpretation

## 2.1. The original method

The original method known as Decoupled Adversarial Policy (DAP) aims to target Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) systems. DAP employs a two-part approach, separating the adversarial policy into two sub-policies: the switch policy and the lure policy. The switch policy assesses whether the attacker should initiate an attack, while the lure policy determines the specific action the attacker persuades the victim to perform. By manipulating the victim's actions, the attacker effectively misguides the DRL system, leading to deceptive outcomes.

To introduce the proposed DAP approach, a convolutional neural network is employed to encode states into a compact one-dimensional feature representation. Additionally, a fully-connected network is utilized to encode policies into another one-dimensional feature representation. These two features are concatenated and passed through an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network to capture sequential patterns. The final stage comprises two branches implemented as fully-connected networks, which generate the switch and lure policies, respectively. The switch policy determines whether launching an attack is warranted, while the lure policy specifies the action the attacker should entice the victim into executing.

In summary, the initial technique called Decoupled Adversarial Policy (DAP) is devised to target Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) systems. It involves separating the adversarial policy into two sub-policies: the switch policy and the lure policy. Manipulating the victim's actions through the lure policy enables the attacker to deceive the DRL system. The proposed DAP approach incorporates a convolutional neural network, a fully-connected network, and an LSTM to encode states, policies, and sequential features. Finally, two branches in the form of fully-connected networks generate the switch and lure policies, respectively, determining the attacker's actions and the victim's responses.

The following algorithm summarizes the part explained above.

## 2.2. Our interpretation 

The original paper provides a clear explanation of the proposed method. However, some technical details were not fully explained, such as the architecture of the neural network used to encode the states and policies. We interpreted these details based on our understanding of the related literature and the experimental results presented in the paper.

In our interpretation, we focused on understanding the technical details of the method that were not explicitly explained in the original paper. For example, the paper mentions the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to encode states and a fully-connected network to encode policies. However, the specific architecture and configuration of these networks were not provided. To address this, we interpreted that the CNN is used to extract spatial features from the states, while the fully-connected network captures the policy information. These features are then concatenated and processed by an LSTM to capture sequential features. Finally, two branches implemented as fully-connected networks are utilized to output the switch and lure policies, respectively.

Furthermore, we interpreted that the switch policy determines whether an attack should be launched based on the current state and policy information, while the lure policy determines the specific action to induce the victim to take. The lure policy is crucial in strategically influencing the victim's actions to achieve the attacker's objectives. By understanding these interpretations, we gain a clearer understanding of the method's architecture and its underlying mechanisms.

Additionally, we considered the implications of the DAP approach in terms of its effectiveness and practicality. We interpreted that the DAP approach offers advantages over existing methods by requiring fewer perturbation injection times to attack DRL systems, thus enhancing its secrecy. This interpretation is based on the experimental results presented in the paper, which demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the DAP approach compared to comparative methods.

Overall, our interpretation of the method focused on filling in the technical details that were not explicitly explained in the original paper. By understanding these details, we gain a more comprehensive understanding of the proposed approach and its potential implications. This interpretation allows us to replicate and evaluate the method accurately, contributing to the reproducibility and reliability of the research.

# 3. Experiments and results

## 3.1. Experimental setup

The experiments were conducted on four different DRL environments, including Pong, Breakout, MsPacman, and Enduro. The widely used algorithms, including DQN and PPO, were applied to train the victim agents. The network trained with DQN outputs the estimate of Q values, and the one trained with PPO outputs the distribution over possible actions. We followed the same experimental setup as described in the original paper. The hyperparameters, such as learning rate, discount factor, and batch size, were set according to the recommendations in the literature. For example, some of such parameters are hardcoded in the code as below.

```python
Episode = 4000
Discount Factor = 0.997
Lambda_r = 0.95 # a hyperparameter in the reward calculation
T = 1500
Max_Inject = 21 # for Pong game

The Results section of the paper presents the experimental evaluation of the proposed DAP approach. The experiments aim to verify the effectiveness of the DAP approach in launching successful attacks on DRL systems and to analyze the effectiveness of different components in learning DAP. The experiments are conducted on four Atari games: Pong, Breakout, Space Invaders, and Seaquest.

The paper compared the proposed DAP approach with existing methods for attacking DRL systems. It demonstrated that the DAP approach outperformed the baseline methods regarding attack success rate and the ability to mislead the victim agents. This comparison provides evidence of the effectiveness of the proposed approach and its potential for practical applications.

While the DAP approach showed promising results, some limitations should be considered. The experiments were conducted on a limited set of DRL environments, and it would be valuable to evaluate the approach on a wider range of tasks. Additionally, the robustness of the DAP approach against defence mechanisms and countermeasures should be investigated in future work.

The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the DAP approach in launching successful attacks on DRL systems. The DAP approach is shown to be more efficient and practical than existing methods for attacking DRL systems. The results show that the DAP approach requires fewer perturbation injection times to launch successful attacks compared to comparative methods. The DAP approach is also shown to be more effective in inducing the victim agent to take specific actions, leading to more significant rewards for the attacker.

The experimental results also analyze the effectiveness of different components in learning DAP. The ablation studies are performed to analyze the effectiveness of different components, including the trajectory clipping and padding in data pruning and DPPO in optimization. The results show that applying either data pruning or DPPO alone cannot learn the well-performed and stable DAP. In fact, both components follow the same design methodology, which focuses on the specificity of attacking DRL, especially the imbalanced distribution in switch policy and the sampled actions' impacts on the attacker's behaviour.

The experimental results also provide insights into the states where the DAP approach is most effective in launching attacks and injecting perturbations. The results show that the DAP approach is most effective in launching attacks in states where the victim agent's policy is uncertain or unstable. The DAP approach is also shown to be effective in inducing the victim agent to take specific actions that lead to significant rewards for the attacker.

Overall, the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed DAP approach in launching successful attacks on DRL systems. The results also provide insights into the effectiveness of different components in learning DAP and the states where the DAP approach is most effective in launching attacks and injecting perturbations. These findings have implications for the development of defence mechanisms against adversarial attacks on DRL systems and contribute to the broader understanding of the vulnerabilities and security challenges in the field of DRL.
