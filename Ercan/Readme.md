ItemSage: Learning Product Embeddings for Shopping Recommendations at Pinterest

# 1. Introduction

Paper is published on ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining in 2022. It proposes a recommender system using multi-modal representation learning. Proposed system uses image and text embeddings to provide better results to Pinterest users. It creates a single embedding for each item and gained +7% improvement in key bussiness metrics.

## 1.1. Paper summary

Pinterest is an image-based social network. Users can search for content by text queries. System recommends contents according to their interests, log histories and also current image. In order to provide fast and effective recommendations and search results to the users, authors created a multi-modal system. 

At Home surface, users get recommendations according to their past activity. In the Closeup surface, recommendation are provided according to the pin the user currently viewing. In the Search surface, recommendations are created according to the search string. All of the surfaces use the same item embeddings.

Each item is represented by 12 text embeddings including title, color etc and at most 20 image embeddings. Images are embedded using the PinSage module of Pinterest which is not available publicly. Texts are embedded using jointly with the system. Text are converted to numerical IDs using vocabulary. Unigrams are selected from most frequently used 200000 words, bigrams are selected from 1000000 tokens and character trigrams are selected from 64000 tokens. Out of vocabulary tokens are neglected.

# 2. The method and my interpretation

## 2.1. The original method

Image embeddings are taken from PinSage module. 
Text embeddings are produced using hashing trick in order to get rid of high vocabulary volume. They used an embedding table E size of 100.000 x 256. And weight table W size of |V|x2 weights. Numerical values for each token is taken from the vocabularies. Then, hashing trick is used to get 2 embeddings for each text token. 2 embeddings are multiplied with their corresponding weigths and summed. 
The global variable CLS is passed through a linear layer.

Authors used transformer encoders to get the relationship among embeddings. First, all embeddings including image, text and CLS are processed through a linear layer size of 512 to convert all embeddings to the same dimensions. Then, embeddings are passed through 1-layer transformer encoder. The global embedding, CLS token is used as the output of the transformer encoder. This embedding is passed through a sequential nonlinear GELU layer to obtain the 256 dimension final embedding. 
Each item is represented by this 256 dimensional embedding. 
For search through the embeddings, each item is transformed into its corresponding embedding and search is done via Approximate Nearest Neighbour Search.

## 2.2. Our interpretation 

Since, PinSage which is used for image embeddings is not available publicly, we emplyed another image embedder for this. We used ResNet50 pretrained on ImageNet as image embedder. And also we did not have most frequently used vocabularies. In  order to overcome this usage, we emplyed hashing trick in this part too. We got numerical IDs for each token by using a hash function. Hash function provided us a value which we used for getting corresponding weigths from weight table W.

Other parts are implemented as it is in the paper. 

We did not have a dataset that is used by Pinterest which has around 20 photos per item. So we used amazon dataset, and try to train the model but could not manage to finish it.
