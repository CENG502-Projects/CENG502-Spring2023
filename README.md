# CENG502 Spring2023

In this repo, as part of the [CENG502 Advanced Deep Learning (Spring 2023)](http://ceng.metu.edu.tr/~skalkan/ADL/) course, several papers at top venues that do not have any implementation are implemented and their results are reproduced. Each folder contains the implementation for one paper, with an accompanying report that summarizes the paper, discusses how the paper is implemented, reports the results and contrasts the results with those in the original paper. Not every project was successfully completed but many projects successfully reproduced the papers or provided results and insights that can be complementary to the original papers. Feel free to browse through the invididual folders (projects) with this in mind.

We hope that this will be an important contribution to those trying to implement or make use of these papers, and to encourage researchers to provide implementations for their papers or if this is not possible, to provide sufficient details in their papers for reproducibility.
